## Example LC-3 Assembly programs

More information on how the programs do what they do can be found in their
corresponding files.

### Compare.asm
This is a program that takes two integers as inputs (range between -999 and
999), and outputs 0 if the first value is equal to the second, 1 if the first
value is larger, and -1 if the second value is larger.

### Fibonacci.asm
This program calculates the nth fibonacci number, where n is an integer between
3 and 23, and outputs it to the display.

### Recursive_Fibonacci.asm
This program is the same as the previous, however it calculates the fibonacci
number using recursion.

### Features.asm
This file is mostly a display of what the Assembler can do.

### Multi_Word_Addition.asm
This program adds two 30 bit numbers together. As the LC3 uses 16 bit words, this
requires two words to complete.
